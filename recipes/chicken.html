    <h3>Chicken description</h3>
      <p>Whole garlic cloves take on a mild flavor when simmered with chicken in a simple white wine-mustard sauce. </p>
      <p> Serve this garlic chicken recipe with smashed potatoes and saut√©ed green beans.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin oil</li>
        <li>1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 cup white wine</li>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly smash garlic cloves with the side of a large knife to loosen the skins.
               Peel; cut larger ones in half. Sprinkle chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown,
               about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon.
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken to the pan and cook until browned on one side, about 4 minutes.
               Turn it over and return the garlic to the pan. Add wine and cook for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk broth, mustard, flour and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.
               Add the mixture to the pan; bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a lively simmer. 
               Cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.
               Serve sprinkled with chives (or scallion greens).
            </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
